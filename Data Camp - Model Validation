####################################Course 1:  Basic Modeling in scikit-learn ####################################
Before we can validate models, we need an understanding of how to create and work with them. 
This chapter provides an introduction to running regression and classification models in scikit-learn. 
We will use this model building foundation throughout the remaining chapters.

-- What is model validation?
1. ensuring your model performs as expected on new data
2. testing model performance on holdout datasets
3. selecting the best model, parameters, and accuracy metrics
4. achieving the best accuracy for the data given



# The model is fit using X_train and y_train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create vectors of predictions
train_predictions = model.predict(X_train)
test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Train/Test Errors
train_error = mae(y_true=y_train, y_pred=train_predictions)
test_error = mae(y_true=y_test, y_pred=test_predictions)

# Print the accuracy for seen and unseen data
print("Model error on seen data: {0:.2f}.".format(train_error))
print("Model error on unseen data: {0:.2f}.".format(test_error))








#################################### Course 2: Validation Basics ####################################
This chapter focuses on the basics of model validation. From splitting data into training, validation, and testing datasets, 
to creating an understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff, we build the foundation for the techniques of K-Fold and Leave-One-Out validation practiced in chapter three.





#################################### Course 3: Cross Validation ####################################
Holdout sets are a great start to model validation. However, using a single train and test set if often not enough. 
Cross-validation is considered the gold standard when it comes to validating model performance and is almost always used when tuning model hyper-parameters. 
This chapter focuses on performing cross-validation to validate model performance.






#################################### Course 4: Selecting the best model with Hyperparameter tuning. ####################################
The first three chapters focused on model validation techniques. 
In chapter 4 we apply these techniques, specifically cross-validation, while learning about hyperparameter tuning. After all, model validation makes tuning possible and helps us select the overall best model.
