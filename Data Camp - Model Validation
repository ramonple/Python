####################################Course 1:  Basic Modeling in scikit-learn ####################################
Before we can validate models, we need an understanding of how to create and work with them. 
This chapter provides an introduction to running regression and classification models in scikit-learn. 
We will use this model building foundation throughout the remaining chapters.

-- What is model validation?
1. ensuring your model performs as expected on new data
2. testing model performance on holdout datasets
3. selecting the best model, parameters, and accuracy metrics
4. achieving the best accuracy for the data given



# The model is fit using X_train and y_train
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create vectors of predictions
train_predictions = model.predict(X_train)
test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Train/Test Errors
train_error = mae(y_true=y_train, y_pred=train_predictions)
test_error = mae(y_true=y_test, y_pred=test_predictions)

# Print the accuracy for seen and unseen data
print("Model error on seen data: {0:.2f}.".format(train_error))
print("Model error on unseen data: {0:.2f}.".format(test_error))




regression model

# Set the number of trees
rfr.n_estimators = 100

# Add a maximum depth
rfr.max_depth = 6

# Set the random state
rfr.random_state = 1111

# Fit the model
rfr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Fit the model using X and y
rfr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print how important each column is to the model
for i, item in enumerate(rfr.feature_importances_):
    # Use i and item to print out the feature importance of each column
    print("{0:s}: {1:.2f}".format(X_train.columns[i], item))





classfication models


# Fit the rfc model. 
rfc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create arrays of predictions
classification_predictions = rfc.predict(X_test)
probability_predictions = rfc.predict_proba(X_test)

# Print out count of binary predictions
print(pd.Series(classification_predictions).value_counts())

# Print the first value from probability_predictions
print('The first predicted probabilities are: {}'.format(probability_predictions[0]))



rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, max_depth=6, random_state=1111)

# Print the classification model
print(rfc)

# Print the classification model's random state parameter
print('The random state is: {}'.format(rfc.random_state))

# Print all parameters
print('Printing the parameters dictionary: {}'.format(rfc.get_params()))



#################################### Course 2: Validation Basics ####################################
This chapter focuses on the basics of model validation. From splitting data into training, validation, and testing datasets, 
to creating an understanding of the bias-variance tradeoff, we build the foundation for the techniques of K-Fold and Leave-One-Out validation practiced in chapter three.


--- Creating train, test, and validation datasets

MAE mean absolute error

MSE mean squared error



-- MAE: 

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Manually calculate the MAE
n = len(predictions)
mae_one = sum(abs(y_test - predictions)) / n
print('With a manual calculation, the error is {}'.format(mae_one))

# Use scikit-learn to calculate the MAE
mae_two = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print('Using scikit-learn, the error is {}'.format(mae_two))



-- MSE:

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

n = len(predictions)
# Finish the manual calculation of the MSE
mse_one = sum((y_test - predictions)**2) / n
print('With a manual calculation, the error is {}'.format(mse_one))

# Use the scikit-learn function to calculate MSE
mse_two = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print('Using scikit-learn, the error is {}'.format(mse_two))





# Find the East conference teams
east_teams = labels == "E"

# Create arrays for the true and predicted values
true_east = y_test[east_teams]
preds_east = predictions[east_teams]

# Print the accuracy metrics
print('The MAE for East teams is {}'.format(
    mae(true_east, preds_east)))

# Print the West accuracy
print('The MAE for West conference is {}'.format(west_error))




Classification metrics

precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, f1-score and its variations


from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test,test_predictions)


from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Create predictions
test_predictions = rfc.predict(X_test)

# Create and print the confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, test_predictions)
print(cm)

# Print the true positives (actual 1s that were predicted 1s)
print("The number of true positives is: {}".format(cm[1, 1]))



from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

test_predictions = rfc.predict(X_test)

# Create precision or recall score based on the metric you imported
score = precision_score(y_test, test_predictions)

# Print the final result
print("The precision value is {0:.2f}".format(score))




-- The bias-variance tradeoff

# Update the rfr model
rfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=25,
                            random_state=1111,
                            max_features=4)
rfr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Print the training and testing accuracies 
print('The training error is {0:.2f}'.format(
  mae(y_train, rfr.predict(X_train))))
print('The testing error is {0:.2f}'.format(
  mae(y_test, rfr.predict(X_test))))
  
  
  
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

test_scores, train_scores = [], []
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50]:
    rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=i, random_state=1111)
    rfc.fit(X_train, y_train)
    # Create predictions for the X_train and X_test datasets.
    train_predictions = rfc.predict(X_train)
    test_predictions = rfc.predict(X_test)
    # Append the accuracy score for the test and train predictions.
    train_scores.append(round(accuracy_score(y_train,  train_predictions), 2))
    test_scores.append(round(accuracy_score(y_test, test_predictions), 2))
# Print the train and test scores.
print("The training scores were: {}".format(train_scores))
print("The testing scores were: {}".format(test_scores))


  
#################################### Course 3: Cross Validation ####################################
Holdout sets are a great start to model validation. However, using a single train and test set if often not enough. 
Cross-validation is considered the gold standard when it comes to validating model performance and is almost always used when tuning model hyper-parameters. 
This chapter focuses on performing cross-validation to validate model performance.


-- The problems with holdout sets
# Create two different samples of 200 observations 
sample1 = tic_tac_toe.sample(200, random_state=1111)
sample2 = tic_tac_toe.sample(200, random_state=1171)

# Print the number of common observations 
print(len([index for index in sample1.index if index in sample2.index]))

# Print the number of observations in the Class column
print(sample1['Class'].value_counts())
print(sample2['Class'].value_counts())



-- Cross-validation

n_split: number of cross-validation splits
shuffle: boolean indicating to shuffle data before splitting
random_state: random seed

from sklean.model_selection import KFold

X = np.array(range(40))
y=np.array([0]*20+[1]*20)

kf=KFold(n_split=5)
splits = kf.split(X)

for train_index, test_index in splits:
          print(len(train_index), len(test_index))





from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# Use KFold
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=1111)

# Create splits
splits = kf.split(X)

# Print the number of indices
for train_index, val_index in splits:
    print("Number of training indices: %s" % len(train_index))
    print("Number of validation indices: %s" % len(val_index))
    
    
    
    


from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

rfc = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=25, random_state=1111)

# Access the training and validation indices of splits
for train_index, val_index in splits:
    # Setup the training and validation data
    X_train, y_train = X[train_index], y[train_index]
    X_val, y_val = X[val_index], y[val_index]
    # Fit the random forest model
    rfc.fit(X_train,y_train)
    # Make predictions, and print the accuracy
    predictions = rfc.predict(X_val)
    print("Split accuracy: " + str(mean_squared_error(y_val, predictions)))

#################################### Course 4: Selecting the best model with Hyperparameter tuning. ####################################
The first three chapters focused on model validation techniques. 
In chapter 4 we apply these techniques, specifically cross-validation, while learning about hyperparameter tuning. After all, model validation makes tuning possible and helps us select the overall best model.
