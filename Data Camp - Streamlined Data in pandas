Course Description
Before you can analyze data, you first have to acquire it. This course teaches you how to build pipelines to import data kept in common storage formats. 
You’ll use pandas, a major Python library for analytics, to get data from a variety of sources, from spreadsheets of survey responses, 
to a database of public service requests, to an API for a popular review site. 
Along the way, you’ll learn how to fine-tune imports to get only what you need and to address issues like incorrect data types. 
Finally, you’ll assemble a custom dataset from a mix of sources.


course 1: Importing Data from Flat Files

pd.read_csv('',sep=)
# sep to pass in the correct delimiter when reading the file

usecols: select particular columns, can either be column names  or column numbers
nrows: limit the number of rows 
skiprows
Set header=None so pandas knows there are no column names
names: assign column names, e.g., names = ['xx','yy','zz'], names=list(xxx)



course 2: Importing Data From Excel Files
course 3: Importing Data from Databases
course 4: Importing JSON Data and Working with APIs
