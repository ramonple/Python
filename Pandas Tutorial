Pandas is a Python library.

Pandas is used to analyze data.




import pandas as pd

mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)

>>>

    cars  passings
0    BMW         3
1  Volvo         7
2   Ford         2





df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(df.to_string). # to_string() function is used to render a DataFrame to a console-friendly tabular output. 



---------------------------- Pandas Series ------------------------
What is a series?
A Pandas Series is like a column in a table. It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.

# create a Pandas Series
import pandas as pd
a = [1,7,2]
myvar = pd.Series(a)
print(myvar)

>>>
0    1
1    7
2    2
dtype: int64
# If nothing else is specified, the values are labeled with their index number. First value has index 0, second value has index 1 etc.



# Create Labels
import pandas as pd
a = [1,7,2]
myvar = pd.Series(a, index = ["x", "y", "z"])
print(myvar)
>>>
x    1
y    7
z    2
dtype: int64

# return the value of 'y'
print(myvar["y"])



import pandas as pd
calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}
myvar = pd.Series(calories)
print(myvar)
>>>
day1    420
day2    380
day3    390
dtype: int64


## To select only some of the items in the dictionary, use the index argument and specify only the items you want to include in the Series.

import pandas as pd
calories = {"day1": 420, "day2": 380, "day3": 390}
myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = ["day1", "day2"]) ==> only use the first two and ingore the third one 'day3'
print(myvar)


-- Data Frames
What is a DataFrame?
A Pandas DataFrame is a 2 dimensional data structure, like a 2 dimensional array, or a table with rows and columns


import pandas as pd

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}
myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(myvar)
>>>
   calories  duration
0       420        50
1       380        40
2       390        45


- Locate Row
print(df.loc[0])
print(df.loc[[0, 1]])
print(df.loc["day2"])

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')


### to return the entire DataFrame. !!!!!!!!!!!
df.to_string() 

### read json
df.read_json()



If you have a large DataFrame with many rows, Pandas will only return the first 5 rows, and the last 5 rows


max_rows
The number of rows returned is defined in Pandas option settings.
You can check your system's maximum rows with the pd.options.display.max_rows statement.

import pandas as pd

print(pd.options.display.max_rows) 




Read JSON

Big data sets are often stored, or extracted as JSON.
JSON is plain text, but has the format of an object, and is well known in the world of programming, including Pandas.
In our examples we will be using a JSON file called 'data.json'.
