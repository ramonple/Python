----------------------------- File Open --------------------------- 

open()

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode

"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

f = open("demofile.txt")

f = open("demofile.txt","rt") # Because "r" for read, and "t" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them.



------------------------ Read Files ------------------------
f = open("demofile.txt","r")
print(f.read())


f = open("D:\\myfiles\\welcome.txt","r")
print(f.read())



f = open("D:\\myfiles\\welcome.txt","r")
print(f.read(5)) # fine how many characters you want to read



Read Lines: readline()

# read one line
f = open("demofile.txt","r")
print(f.readline())


# By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
print(f.readline())


# By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
for x in f:
  print(x)
  
  
  


Close File
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
f.close()




------------------------ Python File Write ------------------------
1. To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

f.write()


f = open("demofile2.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())



2. Create a new file

To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exist

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exist



# create a new file named 'myfile.txt'
f = open("myfile.txt", "x")


 ------------------------ Delete Files ------------------------
 
To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function:

import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")




Check if File exist:

import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
else:
  print("The file does not exist")
  
  
  
  
Delete folder

os.rmdir()

import os
os.rmdir("myfolder")
